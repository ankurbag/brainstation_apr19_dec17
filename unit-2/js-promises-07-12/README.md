# Agenda : Promise
[X] Callback Demo
[X] Callback Hell
 - Error Handling is poor
 - Readability is very poor
 - Modularity is very poor
 
[] Promise Interface
 - Reference : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
 - ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced the JavaScript Promise object.
 - The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
 - A Promise is in one of these states:
    - pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    - fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    - rejected: meaning that the operation failed. 
 - Syntax  
  - Producers : const myPromise = new Promise( (Executor) );
  - Consumers : myPromise.then( <funstionlities> )
  
  - 2 Outcomes : resolve, reject
            myPromise --> resolved
              |
              |
              reject
       
  - Executor













[] Convert CallBack to Promise
[] Benefits of Promise 
 - Escaping Callback Hell
 - Modularity 
 - Readability
 - Better Error Handling model
