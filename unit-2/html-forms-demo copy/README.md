# HTML Forms

> Note: This demo covers a decent amount of code that students would need to implement for BandSite Sprint II, so be mindful of not giving too much away directly.

## Steps to Demo

1. Lecture about HTML forms, how they work, and some of the input types available
2. Lecture about form submission and event handling (likely that's mostly review from the JS Event Handling lecture)
3. Demo the creation of a form in HTML
4. Demo the handling of the form in JS
5. Talk about other considerations with forms

It's a good idea to mention things like:
- `<label>` and its importance
- Attributes like `placeholder`, `disabled`, `autocomplete`, `autofocus`
- Styling input elements
- HTML5 validation:
    - `required`, `min`, `max`, `maxlength`, `novalidate`
    - Certain input types are validated automatically
- JS validation:
    - Doing it on the client side
    - We'll eventually do it on the server side as well
