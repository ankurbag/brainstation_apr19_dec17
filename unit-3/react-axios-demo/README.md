# Axios with React

## Steps to Demo

Start with basic structure, CSS, and Welcome component.
Walk through [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/).

`npm install axios`

1. Sidebar
2. Single Recipe
3. Random Recipe 

## Notes

- This demo is pretty large, so be mindful of time and focus on the core concepts
- If there's time, use NavLink for the sidebar items and style them when active.
- Show all the little gotchas, like rendering during the "loading" state, and re-fetching when props change
- This demo is a great one to use as starter code for a React Hooks refactoring later on!
